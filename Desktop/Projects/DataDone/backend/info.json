        "name": "Logistic Regression",
        "description": "Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification problems, where the goal is to predict the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class. It models the relationship between a dependent binary variable and one or more independent variables by estimating probabilities using a logistic function.",
        "use_statement": "Logistic Regression is commonly used in scenarios where the outcome is categorical, such as spam detection (spam or not spam), medical diagnosis (disease or no disease), or customer churn prediction (churn or no churn). It is particularly useful when the relationship between the independent variables and the log-odds of the dependent variable is linear.",
        "methodology": "Logistic Regression uses maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to fit the logistic function to the data. The logistic function (sigmoid) transforms the linear combination of input features into a probability value between 0 and 1. The model optimizes the coefficients of the input features to minimize the log-loss (cross-entropy) between the predicted probabilities and the actual class labels.",

        "name": "Random Forest",
        "description": "Random Forest is an ensemble learning method used for both classification and regression tasks. It operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes (for classification) or the mean prediction (for regression) of the individual trees. It introduces randomness by bootstrapping the data and selecting a random subset of features for each tree, which helps reduce overfitting and improve generalization.",
        "use_statement": "Random Forest is widely used in applications such as credit scoring, fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and predictive modeling. It is particularly effective when dealing with high-dimensional data, noisy datasets, or when interpretability is less critical compared to performance.",
        "methodology": "Random Forest builds multiple decision trees using bootstrapped samples of the training data. For each tree, a random subset of features is selected at each split, which decorrelates the trees and reduces overfitting. The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of all trees (e.g., majority voting for classification or averaging for regression).",

It assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable and is commonly used for predicting continuous outcomes.",
        "use_statement": "Linear Regression is widely used in fields such as economics (predicting GDP, stock prices), real estate (predicting house prices), and engineering (predicting system performance). It is suitable for scenarios where the relationship between variables is linear and the data meets the assumptions of the model.",
        "methodology": "Linear Regression uses the least squares method to estimate the coefficients of the linear equation. The goal is to minimize the sum of squared residuals (the difference between the observed and predicted values). The model assumes that the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear, and the errors are normally distributed and homoscedastic.",

Each neuron applies a weighted sum of its inputs followed by a non-linear activation function (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid). The model is trained using backpropagation, where gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights are computed and used to update the weights via optimization algorithms like gradient descent.",
